Intro Git Demo

- `git clone <URL>`: takes what's on GitHub and does a one time download to your computer
- `git status`: shows what files are not added or not committed
- `git add <FILE>`: add the <FILE>s to the staging area
- `git commit`: create the commit (aka) snapshot

### Instructions for GitHub...
1. open the readme.md file
2. make a change
3. add and commit your changes
4. done!

- The only thing that adds the files in the origin main is the `git push`
- When you want to fetch the files, the code is `git pull`
- the where is `origin`, and the what is `main`
